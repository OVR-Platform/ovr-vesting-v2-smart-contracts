# OVRVestingV2 Smart Contract

To grant tokens to specified address call (ONLY ADMIN):

```js
granting(
    address _beneficiary, // beneficiary address
    uint256 _amount, // the amount of tokens to be granted
    uint256 _start, // unix start date
    uint256 _end, // unix end date
    bool _revocable // whether the grant is revocable or not
)
```
Use https://www.unixtimestamp.com/ for dates.

It is possible to revoke (ONLY ADMIN) and withdraw the difference between the total amount and the funds already withdrawn by the beneficiary calling:

```js
revoke(
    address _account, // beneficiary address
)
```
